    <h2><b>INTEGRATION OF RES TO EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE</b></h2>
    <h3>Abstract :</h3>
    <p>Electric vehicle (EV) demand is increasing day by day raising one of the major challenges as the lack of charging infrastructure. To reduce the carbon footprint, countries are pushing for the rapid 
					growth of the renewable energy to be used as the source of charging station.
					If electric vehicles must be truly imperishable, it's essential to charge them from sustainable sources of electricity, like solar or wind energy and proper infrastructure and controlsystems of implementing
					a V2G-G2V system in a micro-grid have to be developed.
					In this project, the solar charging station that gives the electricity to charge the battery. The charging station has integrated battery storage that allows for on-grid operation. The DC charging uses the 
					DCpower from the photovoltaic panels directly for charging the vehicles battery and a micro-grid test system is modelled which are carried out the Simulation to demonstrate V2G-G2V power 
					transfer. Test results show active power regulation in the micro-grid by EV batteries through G2V V2G modesof operation and bus voltage regulation. The charging station design ensures minimal 
					harmonic distortion of grid injected current and the controller gives good dynamic performance in terms of dc bus voltage stability.
					We are going to make this using MATLAB/SIMULINK, and the performance of the system is verified by the simulation results</p>
